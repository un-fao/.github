# FAO on GitHub
 
Welcome to the FAO GitHub. Best Practices repository! This project, guidelines, and resources are designed to help teams embed security into every stage of their DevOps lifecycle. Our goal is to drive secure, reliable, and compliant development practices in support of FAO's global mandate.

- **Embed Security Early:** Integrate security considerations from the planning phase.
- **Automate Testing:** Leverage automated security testing and vulnerability scanning.
- **Ensure Continuous Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring and logging for threat detection.
- **Promote Collaboration:** Encourage cross-team dialogue and shared responsibility for security.
